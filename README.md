## Horcrux Hunt

A dark wizard-themed word puzzle game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where players alternate between hiding their souls in emoji puzzles and seeking to destroy others' Horcruxes. This immersive Harry Potter-inspired game combines strategic emoji selection, spatial puzzle-solving, and word deduction into a unique three-layer challenge.

### What is Horcrux Hunt?

Horcrux Hunt is an innovative social puzzle game inspired by Harry Potter's dark magic. Players create emoji-based word puzzles (hiding their soul) and solve puzzles created by others (destroying Horcruxes). The game enforces an alternating gameplay mechanic where you must balance creation and solving to progress.

Each puzzle is a multi-layered logic challenge: a secret Harry Potter-themed word is hidden behind a palette of magical emojis. Players must discover which minimal combination of emojis contains all the letters needed to spell the hidden word. The twist? For multi-emoji puzzles, you must drag and overlap the correct emojis on a Soul Chamber canvas to reveal the letters.

### What Makes This Game Unique?

- **Alternating Gameplay**: New players must destroy their first Horcrux before they can hide their soul. Experienced players must alternate between hiding and seeking, creating a balanced social ecosystem that prevents spam and encourages community engagement
- **Three-Layer Puzzle System**: First, find the minimal emoji combination (Soul Chamber turns golden when correct). Second, reveal letters by overlapping emojis. Third, deduce the hidden Harry Potter word from the revealed letters
- **Minimal Combination Challenge**: The Soul Chamber border turns golden with a magical glow when you've found the exact minimal set of emojis - not all combinations work, adding a strategic layer to the puzzle
- **Overlap Mechanics**: For multi-emoji puzzles, letters only reveal when the correct emojis overlap on the canvas. Single-emoji puzzles reveal letters immediately when the correct emoji is placed
- **Reddit Integration**: Puzzles are published as Reddit posts, creating a persistent community-driven puzzle feed where anyone can play and compete
- **Leaderboard System**: Track your progress with Horcruxes destroyed and souls hidden, and compete with other wizards in your subreddit
- **Dark Wizard Theme**: Immersive Harry Potter-inspired aesthetics with ancient fonts (Cinzel), magical animations, and golden Horcrux glows
- **60+ Magical Emojis**: Choose from wands, lockets, diadems, creatures, potions, and more to craft your puzzles
- **One-Time Solving**: Each puzzle can only be solved once per player, and you cannot solve your own puzzles, ensuring fair competition
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: Real-time feedback in the subtitle shows your current progress - whether you need to find the minimal combination, overlap symbols, or speak the final word
- **Back Button on Confirmation**: If you don't like the generated word, you can go back and select different emojis or change the word length
- **Intelligent Word Generation**: The game automatically finds valid Harry Potter-themed words from your emoji selection using a curated list of 100+ magical terms

### Creating Puzzles (Hiding Your Soul)

After destroying your first Horcrux, you can create your own puzzles:

1. **Click "üåë HIDE SOUL FRAGMENT üîÆ"**: Opens the Soul Concealer screen

5. **Review & Adjust** (Confirmation Screen):
   - Review the generated word on the confirmation screen (remember it!)
   - If you don't like the word, click "üåÄ RETURN TO CONCEALMENT" to go back and select different emojis or change the word length
   - If you're happy with the word, click "‚ú® SEAL THE HORCRUX ‚ú®" to proceed

6. **Publish**:
   - Your puzzle is created as a Reddit post in the subreddit
   - Other players can now find and solve your Horcrux
   - You'll see a success screen: "üåë SOUL FRAGMENT SEALED üåë" with the hidden word displayed
   - After 5 seconds, you'll automatically return to the main menu

  - The "HIDE SOUL FRAGMENT" button is disabled until you complete your first puzzle
  - Error message: "üîÆ New to the Dark Arts? You must first find a Horcrux to learn the forbidden magic before you can hide your own soul!"

- **Experienced Players**: Must alternate between destroying and hiding
  - After hiding your soul ‚Üí you must destroy a Horcrux next
  - After destroying a Horcrux ‚Üí you must hide your soul next
- **Enforcement**: Buttons are disabled with themed error messages if you try to break the alternating rule:

  - If you try to hide twice in a row: "‚ö° You just hid your soul! Now you must find and destroy a Horcrux before hiding another piece of your soul."
  - If you try to destroy twice in a row: "üåë You just found a Horcrux! Now you must hide a piece of your soul before seeking another Horcrux."

### Game Mechanics

- **Minimal Combination Detection**: Each puzzle has a specific minimal set of emojis that must be used

  - The Soul Chamber border turns **golden** (with a glowing effect and radial gradient background) when you've found the correct combination
  - You can't just use any emojis - only the minimal set works
  - The subtitle updates to: "‚ú® Soul combination found! Place the symbol to reveal runes." (for single-emoji) or "‚ú® Soul combination found! Overlap symbols to reveal more runes." (for multi-emoji)

- **Letter Revelation Logic**:

  - **1-emoji puzzles**: Letters reveal immediately when you place the correct emoji (only 1 emoji can be placed in the chamber)
  - **Multi-emoji puzzles**: Letters reveal only when correct emojis **overlap** on the canvas (emojis must be close enough that their circular boundaries intersect)
  - Letters appear as glowing golden runes in individual boxes at the top with a magical entrance animation
  - All instances of each letter are revealed (including duplicates in the correct order)

- **Dragging & Positioning**:

  - Drag emojis from the Magical Symbols list to the Soul Chamber (HTML5 drag-and-drop)
  - Drag emojis within the Soul Chamber to reposition and overlap them (mouse-based dragging)
  - Double-click an emoji in the Soul Chamber to return it to the Magical Symbols list
  - Click the "üåÄ Clear" button to remove all emojis from the chamber at once
  - For single-emoji puzzles, only one emoji can be placed in the chamber at a time

- **Guessing System**:

  - You get **5 attempts** to guess the word correctly (displayed in "‚ö° Attempts" counter)
  - Input field only activates once all letters are revealed (subtitle changes to "‚ö° All soul runes revealed! Speak the word to destroy the Horcrux!")
  - Guesses are automatically converted to uppercase
  - Incorrect guesses decrease your remaining attempts
  - After 5 failed attempts, the game ends with "üíÄ DARK MAGIC PREVAILS üíÄ" screen and reveals the word
  - The attempts counter turns red when you have 2 or fewer attempts remaining

- **Ownership Protection**: You cannot solve your own puzzles

  - Golden message: "ü™Ñ This Soul Fragment is yours! You cannot destroy your own Horcrux. Share it with fellow wizards or create a new one!"

- **One-Time Solving**: Each puzzle can only be solved once per player

  - Golden message: "‚ö° You have already destroyed this Horcrux! The dark magic has been vanquished. Seek other Soul Fragments to continue your quest!"

- **Wizard Rankings**: Click "üëë WIZARD RANKINGS" to view:
  - "üëë WIZARD RANKINGS üëë" title with golden gradient effect
  - Member statistics showing "üßô Total Wizards" and "‚ö° Horcrux Destroyers"
  - Your current stats highlighted in purple: "üëë Your Rank: #X" and "‚ö° Power: X"
  - Leaderboard showing all players ranked by Horcruxes destroyed (total score)
  - ü•áü•àü•â medals for top 3 players with golden highlighting and glow effects
  - Each player's username, rank, and total power (Horcruxes destroyed)
  - Hover effects on leaderboard entries for better interactivity
  - "‚úï Close" button to return to the main menu

## How the Puzzle Algorithm Works

The game uses a sophisticated algorithm to create challenging three-layer puzzles:

1. **Emoji Selection**: Players choose 5-15 emojis, each with a name (e.g., "wand", "snake", "fire")

2. **Word Generation**: The system searches for Harry Potter-themed words that can be formed using letters from the selected emoji names
   - Filters the word list (100+ Harry Potter terms) by the chosen word length (5-9 letters)
   - Checks if each word can be formed from the combined letters of all selected emoji names
   - Randomly selects one valid word from the filtered list

3. **Minimal Combination Calculation**: The algorithm determines the smallest subset of emojis needed to spell the word
   - Uses a combination generator to test all possible subsets starting from size 1
   - Finds the minimum size `k` where at least one combination can form the word
   - Returns up to 3 different minimal combinations of that size
   - Example: If the word is "WAND" and you selected emojis with names "wand", "snake", "fire", only "wand" is needed (minimal count = 1)
   - Example: If the word is "FIRE" and you selected "wand", "ice", "forest", "eagle", you might need ["fire"] or ["ice", "forest", "eagle"] depending on letter availability

4. **Three-Layer Puzzle Solving**: Players must:
   - **Layer 1 - Combination Discovery**: Discover which emojis form the minimal combination (Soul Chamber turns golden when correct)
   - **Layer 2 - Letter Revelation**: For single-emoji puzzles, place the correct emoji to reveal all letters. For multi-emoji puzzles, overlap the correct emojis to reveal letters (overlap detection uses circular boundary intersection)
   - **Layer 3 - Word Deduction**: Guess the hidden Harry Potter word from the revealed letters within 5 attempts

This creates a multi-layered puzzle: first find the right emoji combination, then reveal the letters through overlap, then deduce the word!
