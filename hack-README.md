# ‚ö° Horcrux Hunt - Reddit Devvit Game ‚ö°

## 1. Introduction

**Horcrux Hunt** is an interactive puzzle game built on Reddit's Devvit platform, inspired by the dark magic of the Harry Potter universe. Players take on the role of wizards who must hide their soul fragments in magical symbols and seek out others' Horcruxes to destroy them.

The game combines emoji-based puzzle creation with word-guessing mechanics, creating a unique social gaming experience where players alternate between being puzzle creators (hiding souls) and puzzle solvers (destroying Horcruxes). Built with React, TypeScript, and Devvit's web framework, it runs entirely within Reddit posts, making it accessible to millions of Reddit users.

### Key Features:
- üåë **Hide Soul Fragments**: Create puzzles by selecting magical emoji symbols that spell out secret words
- ‚ö° **Destroy Horcruxes**: Solve other players' puzzles by placing emojis and revealing hidden letters
- üëë **Wizard Rankings**: Compete on the leaderboard to become the most powerful wizard
- üéÆ **Alternating Gameplay**: Players must alternate between hiding and seeking to maintain balance
- üì± **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

## 2. What This Game Does

### Core Gameplay Loop

#### Phase 1: Soul Concealment (Puzzle Creation)
1. **Select Magical Symbols**: Choose 5-15 emojis from a collection of 124+ Harry Potter-themed symbols
2. **Choose Word Length**: Pick a word length (5-9 letters)
3. **Generate Puzzle**: The system finds a valid word that can be spelled using letters from your selected emojis
4. **Publish to Reddit**: Your puzzle is posted as a Reddit post for others to solve

#### Phase 2: Horcrux Destruction (Puzzle Solving)
1. **View the Challenge**: See the available emoji symbols and empty letter slots
2. **Place Emojis**: Drag and drop emojis onto the "Soul Chamber" canvas
3. **Reveal Letters**: When emojis overlap correctly, letters from the secret word are revealed
4. **Guess the Word**: Once all letters are revealed, type the word to destroy the Horcrux
5. **Limited Attempts**: You have 5 attempts to guess correctly, with a 5-minute cooldown on failed attempts

### Social Features
